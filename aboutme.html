      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Sophia Hernandez (she/her/ella) and this is my honors portfolio! I am from Wenatchee, Washington (#509) where I was raised by my loving Mexican-Salvadoran immigrant family. I am a first-generation college student who just earned TWO Bachelor Degrees in Education, Communities, and Organizations (ECO) & Political Science.</p>

      <p>I am a queer, Latina, super cool, so funny, mega smart, emoji-lover who is passionate about education equity justice!</p>

      <p>While this portfolio is made because Interdisciplinary Honors is telling me to do it (lol), I wanted it to be an archive of my experience here at the UW. I explain more of this in my <em>Learning Statement</em> so you can read that if you so desire. While it is a presentation of my academic career, I also exist outside of this institution and experienced major personal changes during my college years (because literally who doesnâ€™t?) and wanted to bring my whole self to this project.</p>

      <p>In the near-future, I plan to work for about a year or two in any government agency, schools (administration), or student services to figure out what specific job I want to work towards. I also plan to use this time to rest, be with the community, and reconnect with my hobbies, goals, and self .</p>

      <p>Once I know the career path I want to follow, I plan to apply to graduate school (in Education Policy or Public Administration) or even law school! In whatever jobs I take on, I just know that I want to be in just a relationship with the community and feel fulfilled in my role.</p>
