      <h1>Learning Statement</h1>

      <p>At the beginning of each month, I curate a music playlist that includes some of my favorite songs, new tunes, or even some oldies I rediscover. I have done this every month over the last 5 years. As time goes on and I create new sets, I will often go back and relisten to one of these monthly playlists. Each song and album is associated with a feeling, memory, or general understanding of that period in my life and who I am. I am brought back to specific moments in my life and it is like I am reliving that moment in time. Music has always had a special place in my heart.</p>

      <p>I present my time at the University of Washington through this portfolio as I have lived through each month, quarter, and year: through my monthly playlists. Each quarter is represented by a playlist in chronological order. Through each of these playlists, I include the courses and extracurricular activities I was involved in within that time. However, I also want to use this space to detail my experiences outside of the classroom.</p>

      <p>As a first-generation college student raised in rural Washington and by my loving Mexican-Salvadoran immigrant community, I faced significant challenges in balancing family responsibilities, cultural shifts, and overall just relearning who I was as an individual. I constantly reflected on my role within my community, my relationships, the University of Washington, and in my future career. Despite periods of feeling directionless, I have learned to embrace the complexity of being human. I experienced cycles of heartache and euphoria (as we all do) in various capacities and I have learned more about myself and others each time. Just as songs can be joyful or somber, the lessons I have learned have shown itself in a vast myriad of ways.</p>

      <p>I list a few life lessons presented as genres, the themes of my UW experiences. While I have learned so much through my courses, these genres have shaped my future academic and interpersonal aspirations as well.</p>

      <ul style="text-align: left; line-height: 2;">
        <li><strong>Be intentional:</strong> live with integrity and meaning within academics, career, relationships, and self.</li>
        <li><strong>Find belonging:</strong> to practice vulnerability to feel truly accepted as I am. Finding authenticity and parts of my whole self in the work I do.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose and destiny:</strong> everything has a purpose, even the small actions and moments matter. Relearning my goals, ambitions, and hopes for the future.</li>
        <li><strong>Love for learning:</strong> learning new information, skills, and being able to critical thinking is so powerful.</li>
        <li><strong>Facing complexity:</strong> navigating complex institutions, internal dilemmas, and just day-to-day challenges is a part of the process.</li>
        <li><strong>Legacy and memory:</strong> consider the power in archiving memories, stories, and experiences in our institutions and communities. Savor relationships & make time for the things that matter.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>These genres are examples of the academic and personal development I made within my undergraduate experiences. In a true interdisciplinary manner, my career and personal interests lie in the intersection between education, politics, and the legal system. I believe that education is a liberatory, historically violent, and inherently political system that can be a source of alleviating system injustice (or even perpetuating them). In defining education as a political space, it is apparent to see how educational inequities further perpetuate other social injustices. I was able to grasp these connections through informal and formal learning sources like UW courses, my family, friends and peers, internships, community organizing, social media, international travel, and so much more.</p>

      <p>My journey at the University of Washington has been influenced by a multitude of events occurring within my own life and by the changes happening globally. I use this portfolio as an opportunity to reflect and archive my holistic undergraduate experience. I will continue to use my learning in the spaces I enter in the future. I know that as time passes, I can re-listen to a playlist from this time period and be grounded in these experiences once again.</p>

      <p><em>P.S. For every class, I added a song that I was really into at the time. They do not have any correlation to the class itself! Just wanted to share a handful of songs I cherish <3</em></p>
