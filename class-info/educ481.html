        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This is a letter I wrote to myself at the beginning of my senior year as we began the formal ECO Internship period. As you can see, I was very excited to take on the role of the Legislative Intern for WAESN and the ability to advocate for the implementation of ethnic studies at the state level. I wrote this at the beginning of the year and hadn’t read it until our last ECO class. Reflecting on my perspective now that I’ve gone through the experience of it, I would say that I may have been wearing some rose-colored glasses. While I was energetic to step into the role, I wasn’t prepared for the challenges we would face in being ethnic study advocates as individuals and an organization. I reflect more on this experience in the WAESN tab but my perspective did change since writing the letter, in both good and bad ways. But, my hopes and dreams for education and ethnic studies remains the same.
