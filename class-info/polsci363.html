        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          The set of courses that I had for this spring quarter were pivotal in finding my academic
and personal ambitions. As you might be able to tell, I am a chronic overthinker and I will always reflect on my positionality, intent, and purpose within all the things I do. Specifically, it was an awakening that I had over-romanticized the idea of becoming a lawyer and what my role in the legal profession would entail. I overlooked the limitations of the legal system in becoming a space of advocacy that I aim to engage in. My desire to be a changemaker in the legal system dismissed the belief I have about oneâ€™s ability to be an advocate no matter their academic background or designated professional role.
	However, to recenter my reflection to this course, I did enjoy the technical writing and research skills that were a part of this final assignment. Of course, I chose to look at the federal cases that addressed the constitutionality of affirmative action in higher education. This paper examines two cases of affirmative action practices and the personal insights I offer in how the court should rule. The ability to continue linking my passion for legal and educational justice in academic spaces is what I enjoyed most from these courses. Although I no longer had full confidence in continuing my career within the legal system, I know that in whatever roles and fields I pursue, I can always continue to be an educational justice advocate through social, legal, political, and cultural avenues.
