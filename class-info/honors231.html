        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          	Honors231â€“Leadership, Democracy, and a More Thoughtful Public is the first honors course I completed which was incredibly interesting but also very challenging. In this class, an analysis of the dense readings and weekly written reflections were expected. I personally struggled with fully grasping the main ideas from the readings as I found it difficult to annotate on my own. However, I felt that by the end of the quarter I was able to make sense of all readings and class concepts which is demonstrated through the 10-page final paper. In this paper, I wrote about the moral obligations that each individual has in actively participating in their communities, political spaces, and relationships overall. Historically and currently, political engagement across young people and BIPOC communities is actively discouraged and suppressed. With that, it is so important to reconnect with the idea that there is a moral obligation to collectively organize and engage in socio-political spaces.
