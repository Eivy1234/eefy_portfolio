        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          For this class, I included a portion of my notes from the lecture that compare the 4 main Political Scientists we learned about in the quarter: Aristotle, Locke, Marx, and Ardent. I learned very quickly that I was not particularly interested in political theory and it made me heavily reconsider whether I was going to pursue the PoliSci degree. While knowing political theory is incredibly vital to the study of political science, I was struggling to find the relevance to what I wanted to do in the future. From this point, I began exploring other related majors (like Law, Societies, and Justice) but still giving PoliSci a chance. This course reminded me that not all aspects of my study excite me but are still an integral part of the field.
