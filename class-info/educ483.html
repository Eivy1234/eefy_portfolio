        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          The last artifact that I share for my academics is this ECO yearbook! This is the first time a cohort has made a yearbook to commeratore our time within this program and celebrate each other. I decided to join the yearbook committee because it seemed like a fun way to create a keepsake. The committee had so many great ideas and honestly we ended up with a pretty solid yearbook! I am choosing not to share the whole yearbook for privacy and safety but here is the back cover which includes a group picture and our shared playlist! Incredibly thankful for all the people I met through this program and for all the lessons I am taking away from my ECO journey, Congratulations to the ECO Class of 2025! ðŸŽ“ðŸ¥‚
