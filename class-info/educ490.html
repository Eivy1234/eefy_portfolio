        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I enrolled in the class after I had some last minute changes in my schedule, so there was nothing specific that compelled me to take this class. The course was offered entirely remotely which meant that it was incredibly accessible and flexible which was so helpful. However, I felt that some of the content was a bit repetitive in thinking about how we would uplift equity in our future places of work. One activity I really did like was this Quilt. The assignment was to select 12 forms of media, people, or sources of interest that reflected who we are. From there, we analyzed the identities represented in the quilt and reflected on how one group may be over/underrepresented. I think this is a really easy way for folks to reflect on the type of media we consume and what parts of ourselves we interact with the most. This could be done using a mood board, instagram post, or your spotify playlist. Anyway, enjoy my little quilt!
