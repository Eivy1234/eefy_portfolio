          Okay, I am going to be real for a minute…I think this is the kind of math that I was looking for at the beginning of the school year. But anywho, this was a fun class that I took with one of my close friends which made the whole process even more fun (woohoo!). Up until this point, many of my education classes looked at education from a sociological perspective versus a focus on the technical teaching aspects of schooling. While I had some informal teaching experience as a tutor at Canopy, I had the opportunity to observe learning from other students in the classroom. This interview assignment required that we prepare a few math problems for an elementary student to solve and we were to analyze their thinking in connection to class topics. Overall, it was interesting to witness the multiple forms of thinking and problem solving within the practice of math. I think this also highlights the importance for educators to understand common problem-solving techniques to better support a student’s learning and relationship with math.
