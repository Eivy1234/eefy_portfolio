        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          “<em>Chat, I am so cooked</em>” is the phrase that got me through completing this course. This was a challenging class due to the complexity of corruption, especially the theoretical concepts of illicit behavior, and just the general history that the world has with unethical leaders. While this class definitely humbled me, I learned a handful of interesting facts and academic ideas about black markets, mafias, gangs, and pirates! I do think it is interesting to intellectualize these groups that operate outside of the established societal institutions and norms. However, these acts are closely related to gaps in economic inequality, abuses of power, and inherent social differences. While it is unlikely that I will continue studying global corruption in academia, I definitely can say that “<em>I lowkey ate with that final exam.</em>”
