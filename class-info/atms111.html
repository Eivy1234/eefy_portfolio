        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Although this class was online, I was able to reconnect with an old friend who happened to be taking the class at the same time. My artifact for this course is a picture of one of the first assignments we completed together which honestly was a bit more difficult than I was anticipating. Since this class covers a topic out of my field, I did expect that I would struggle just a tiny bit especially understanding the real science behind climate changes. However, I enjoyed the class and learned a lot about the intersections between climate change and climate justice on a global scale. I received an expansive level of not only the causes of climate change but also current efforts to mitigate global warming. I was able to gain a greater grasp about how Western-domoinant countries highly contribute to these changes (rising temperatures, rising sea levels, e.g.) while smaller countries bear the burden of the natural disasters. As I reflect on the course content currently, it is clearer how recent warfare has also contributed to distortion of the natural environment and the disproportionate harm placed upon marginalized peoples.
