        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Chicano Studies courses are one of few classes where I am surrounded by peers who share similar identities as I. CHSTU200 was the first course where I experienced a classroom full of Latine students, many of whom were from Eastern Washington. In addition to this, I felt very connected to the content of the class and was able to take on an academic perspective to the issues my community was also facing. This final paper, written in collaboration with my Aunt (we’re basically like sisters at this point), explored a topic that I felt really connected to: the use of Latinx. I began using the word “Latinx” after discovering the inclusive intentions on social media. However, this course challenged my attitude on the term as I discovered it was created through academia. While there is nothing inherently wrong with the world of academia, this is when I truly learned the concept of the “ivory tower.” From this point on, I recognized the limitations of higher education and the relevance our research holds with my community members who are furthest from it.
