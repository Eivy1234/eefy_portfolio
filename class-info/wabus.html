        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
        Since being exposed to ideas of feminism through family, social media, childhood idols (shoutout Rowan Blanchard omg), I intentionally connected with movements and efforts of resisting machismo and white supremacy. In my teen years, my activism appeared through my capacity as an involved student which meant using my platform and any possible outlet to share my learnings of intersectionality. After leaving my hometown, I wasnâ€™t entirely sure how to jump into the Seattle organizing coalitions but found The Washington Bus through a close friend. 
	    In this two-month fellowship, I was inspired by the community members who took their time to share their own experiences as Queer, BIPOC, anti-capitalist organizers operating in white-centered workspaces. The guest speakers and my other peers uplifted and affirmed the parts of me I was still contending with, like my queer identity. I will always be grateful that I crossed paths with these wonderful people, even if it was a remote connection. 
        I gained a deeper understanding of multiple non-profit organizations and even had the opportunity to support a campaign to implement Ranked Choice Voting in Clark County. I helped to support voter registration efforts through attending the Capitol Hill Block Party (which was really intimidating at first but people were so sweet!). Overall, The Washington Bus offered me a pathway to formally engage in organizing and also shaped the trajectory of my career from that point on. Later in the year, I would go on to serve as a Legislative Intern during the 2023 Legislative Session which would have not been possible without the relationships I built through this space. This experience showed me how care and work can be balanced in the workplace and organizing efforts despite systems trying to tear that apart.
