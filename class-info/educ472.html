        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          EDUC472 aimed to take a structural, human resource, political, and symbolic analysis-approach to schools and organizations. Through these four frames, we can evaluate education and its institution on multiple levels. The political frame interested me the most because we related these theories to the real history of Seattle’s education. As explained in the lecture slides, Seattle’s Busing Program is an integration reform that caused socio-political divides. I thought that was the most interesting aspect because it highlights the political tensions within education equity. Further, it can help to explain how Seattle schools still remain fairly segregated and unequal in resource allocation.
