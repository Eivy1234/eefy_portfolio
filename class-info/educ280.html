        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          	I entered the UW with a firm decision of the academic pathway I wanted to pursue which was education and politics. However, I wasn’t entirely sure what majors would best suit this intersection of interests. After taking this class, I felt that ECO was the best choice because of it’s focus on education equity and justice. I also felt that it would offer broader opportunities in future careers outside of a teaching-specific pathway. Through this assignment, we were tasked to research specific careers in which I explored the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI). I was able to scope out possible administrative roles that I could pursue after graduation. Now, I am still interested in this pathway but have had much more interaction with OSPI through other internships. It was incredibly insightful to see the formal positions that align with my interest and career goals that I am still working towards today.
