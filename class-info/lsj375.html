        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
        This class reviewed the systemic ways that immigration, poverty, mental health, and race are overcriminalized in the criminal legal system. While I have had previous knowledge of the systemic oppression of immigrants and BIPOC people, I learned the specific ways in which impoverished people are overcriminalized and often incarcerated at longer lengths. One of the most meaningful assignments for this course was to watch a film and relate course concepts to our analysis. I decided to watch The Central Park Five which details the case of 5 Black and Latino teens who were falsely accused of a murder in 1989. While I have heard of the case previously, I was never fully informed about the events that took place. It is absolutely heartbreaking to watch the live footage of the teens during their interrogation and to know that this racism still plagues our criminal legal system. I reflect on how their socio-economic status influenced their experience within the system but also connect concepts I learned from other courses. While police brutality is still a prevalent issue, it is vital to recognize the new spaces that the BIPOC people become overcriminalized, like in schools through the School-To-Prison-Pipeline. I encourage all to watch the documentary as it offers an important perspective of the  violence inflicted onto BIPOC men in the criminal legal system.
