        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I completed this reflection at the end of my first quarter at UW. As I shared in my writing,
          I was navigating through a lot of changes, as many freshmen do, but still was very hopeful
          about the opportunities that I would have access to. I didnâ€™t know at the time, but I would later
          be offered an internship placement at Canopy Scholars through the UCBI program. My involvement
          in Canopy continued all the way through my Junior year and impacted my connection to Seattle and
          education in ways I did not anticipate. I share more of my Canopy experience in another section but
          I believe this reflects how I practiced intentionality. I was willing to take initiative to develop
          my professional experiences, despite my concerns. This course and reflection reveal how I wanted
          to tend to my years here at the UW: care, exploration, and intentionality.
