        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Once my internship with UCBI was completed at the end of my freshman year, I had a deep conversation with my supervisor about my journey with Canopy. Even though I was not going to be in Seattle at the time, we reached an agreement that I could complete remote work on to improve the supplemental curriculum. During the year, students are expected to complete their homework and then to finish the worksheets we provided. However, I quickly realized that the worksheets we assigned misaligned with their own learning–students had either not learned the material or they had already mastered the concept. To make the material more meaningful, I worked closely with an Elementary Math Teacher who frequently tutored at Canopy. In learning about the timeline and units that each grade level follows, I created appropriate worksheets that would give students the ability to practice the topics they were actively learning in the classroom. 
Additionally, to develop their comprehension skills I research a few resources to create a vocabulary curriculum to allow students to actually engage with new words. Instead of reading a random prompt, students now had methods to grasp new vocabulary. This required greater intentionality in setting a curriculum as it wasn’t following any school-district standard. I felt that this work helped to structure the learning happening at Canopy for the years to come not only for the students but also for myself.
