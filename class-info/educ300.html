        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          In Lak'ech: tu eres mi otro yo / you are my other me
	      I first learned of In Lak’ech through this course and it felt very meaningful– it is a testament that we are all interconnected. I cannot be truly free, well, and whole until all people experience freedom and the ability to express joy. 
        This poem has been targeted in schools and was effectively banned in Arizona schools. This is just another example of the outright erasure of Mayan philosophies and Indigenous ways of being that teach empathy and integrity. The film,<a href="https://www.kanopy.com/en/product/155997?vp=washington" target="_blank"> Precious Knowledge</a>, documents how ethnic studies curriculum has been attacked by school leaders but also the student voices that have fought for the preservation of ethnic studies. I encourage all to watch the film and to reflect on the poem to reflect on the importance of ethnic studies and curriculum in schools to foster confidence, belonging, and empowerment amongst underrepresented students. Further, we must continue to encourage critical thinking and advocacy through ethnic studies to allow BIPOC students to be active change makers.
