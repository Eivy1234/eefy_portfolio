      <h1>Educ340: Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies: Teaching and Learning for Justice in a Changing World</h1>
      <h2 class="class-description">
        purpose and destiny
      </h2>
      Culturally Sustaining Pedagogies, (CSP) is a book I read as part of a course centered around the ideas of what it means to have culturally sustaining schools, curriculum, and spaces. The book and class were taught by Django Paris, a professor who has always been incredibly supportive to his students and committed to their learning. Through this book, I was able to continue conversations that I have had in my own life in connection to my identity. 

      The concept of “ni de aqui, ni de alla” is still an integral experience faced within my community and I saw that the education system took part in that reinforcement. As I learned more about CSP, I realized that although we do want to create schools that sustain our culture, there is the reality that things will change. New generations of students will continue to change and redefine their cultural identity in new and traditional ways–this is not necessarily a bad thing. We just have to adapt our learning to not only allow cultural identities to survive, but to also thrive. CSP is a practice in which we must ask ourselves, what are we seeking to sustain?

      As we do in all aspects of our lives, we sustain what we love.
