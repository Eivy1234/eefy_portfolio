        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Okay can I be super real with y’all right now? This was not the class for me. The structure and the content of the course was quite unorganized and disconnected. I share my discontent with this class because I really do think it has the potential to analyze the socio-political consequences of death and be a really intriguing course, but unfortunately I have some critiques. 
	But, the one thing I will say about this class is that it made us actually do something. Known as “action groups,” students were put into groups and paired with an advocacy organization with the intent to host some sort of program, informative event, or anything that would support the organization’s goals. I was placed into the Forest-Action group which called for the protection of Legacy Forests in Washington State against deforestation. Did you know that UW, Washington State University, and the Office of Superintendent of Public Instruction (OSPI) receives money from timber sales? This is a major ethical conflict as our schools should not approve the deforestation of legacy forests (that sequester so much carbon) for the sake of additional funding. So, we testified at the Department of Natural Resources committee in which board members approve or deny the deforestation of land in Washington (<a href="https://www.dnr.wa.gov/about/boards-and-councils/board-natural-resources" target="_blank">link to more information</a>). 
	I gave my testimony online but some of my classmates went in-person (these can be found <a href="https://tvw.org/video/washington-state-board-of-natural-resources-2023111009/?eventID=2023111009" target="_blank">here</a>). Apparently, Chris Reykdal (WA Superintendent, OSPI) cried after hearing my speech. And like okay yes power move for me but Mr. Reykdal, I need to see you push against these boundaries! Okay so this class did bring about the importance of using our education to take action so I appreciate that, but it was a rocky journey.
