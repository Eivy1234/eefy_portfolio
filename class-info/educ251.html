        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          EDUC251 is an infamous ECO course known for the incredible professor, Jondou Chen,
and the impactful course content. Throughout each week, we explore a different aspect of intersectional identities and give space to share those stories. However, I am someone who had to reflect on my identities earlier in my life simply because it was necessary to make sense of my place within a white-centered education system and culture. I did want to share one of the most memorable moments I have from this course which was when I first discovered Carmen Lomas Garza’s artwork. It was a familiar feeling and it reminded me of the art pieces I would see in Mexico or El Salvador. I was able to connect with the art through my own experiences despite this being a collective memory of the Latine community. I adore Lomas Garza’s work and it’s always worthwhile to reshare our connection to art.
