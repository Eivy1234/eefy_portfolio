        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          As I mentioned before, my interest in education doesn’t necessarily come from a passion for teaching and working with young children. However, I do believe that teaching is an incredibly fundamental role that needs to be institutionally supported. I wanted to have some teaching experience because I think it is important to have a well-rounded understanding of the ins-and-outs of our school system, and I do enjoy being around kids so that’s a plus! I somehow ended up working with middle schoolers for the last 4 years through Canopy Scholars. When presented with the option to take a human-development class, I knew that I wanted to focus on adolescent development. Garnering a better understanding of the types of development adolescents undergo allowed me to better support my own students in thinking long-term and navigating their social relationships. Furthermore, I was inspired by my students' constant screen-aging to make my presentation about the influence of social media on their development. I was able to bring in my learning from this course and from tutoring to create this informative project.
