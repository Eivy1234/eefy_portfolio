        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          One of the biggest perks of the Honors Program was being able to enroll in an additional
seminar course for Law 100. I loved this class x10000 and sent me towards a new career path. At this point, I was straying away from the legal pathways but I was drawn back to the idea of becoming a lawyer. While I was interested in the structure of the legal system, this seminar also offered an in-depth examination of how the system is designed to sustain sexism, racism, poverty, ableism, and other forms of oppression. Even though the system is clearly unethical, I had a firm belief that I could challenge these notions within the system as a lawyer. It was eye-opening to learn from these readings, my peers, and Professor Myers and impacted my career and personal goals. 
	This reading was assigned during the week where we were learning about tort law. The author discussed how remedies for tort cases typically appear monetarily. I was struck by the idea that justice primarily is served through financial compensation. In addition, the amount given to victims of tort violations is based on economic tables that determine the value through gender identity. Obviously, this is inherently inequitable and immoral as we value one personâ€™s harm less than another simply for their gender identity. Furthermore, what does it look like to equate justice to money? How does monetary value give justice to those who suffer physical and mental trauma? 
	While the legal institution is complex, I was determined that I was going to make institutional change through the role of a lawyer. While I have yet to figure out whether that is a possibility, the next following courses really challenged this strong belief.
