        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          After my involvement in the JSI program, I became interested in conducting research. While I felt that it was a bit too late for me to get involved in any research projects during my senior year, I believe it is an opportunity I can pursue in graduate school. To get some more familiarity with the mathematical side of research, I decided to take this class to learn the basic foundations of statistics. Professor Sanders is an incredible instructor who left me feeling confident in understanding the language of stats, so shoutout! This artifact is from our first midterm in which I aced the test after studying all night. For real though, I have always loved solving math problems so this was the real reconnection. Because of this class, I even attended a coding workshop in R! I plan to develop my stats skill and learn more about R in the future.
