        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I do not have the ability to put into words how much this study abroad trip meant to me. It was such a needed journey for me as I was processing grief and internal changes in my personal life. I never would have imagined that I would get the opportunity to travel for school (and for free!) and I am so grateful I pushed myself to engage in this experience #woulddothisagain. 
	During my month-long trip, I took many pictures and wrote daily in a journal. I won’t pour everything I did, saw, or felt into this reflection but I will offer some pictures of the wonderful moments I got to witness! This is memory and archiving in real time ;) But in case you realllyyyy wanted to take a peek at my diary, here is a little entry from July 11th (Day 22):
	“Hearing their life stories was very emotional and heavy. I feel incredibly grateful that they are willing to share (and everyone we’ve met with) because it shows another level of vulnerability that I have not been exposed to. A couple days ago, we were having a conversation about what it means to be radical and push against the system. And someone said that in these intense moments, being radical is simply just existing and that itself has so much power. I have been connecting this idea to the artists we’ve met and especially with these politicians. It also reminds me of how much I used to be involved in these intersectional, feminist, and queer movements/theories but with the last few years, I have been going through a lot of familial changes that have made me feel disconnected from my community and these larger ideas of equality, justice, and love. I feel for those who have experienced varying forms of oppression and violence and how important it is to maintain joy and hope even when it seems like there is no reason to. Listening to these women in power validate my studies (education and politics) was so needed and something that I had not heard in a while. Though there were moments of this conversation that left me teary-eyed, it has allowed me to reflect on my own passions, hopes, and power within the world. 
	I don’t know how much I really want to go into depth with the rest of the day because I cannot take away from the importance of this discussion. But here is the most generalized rundown: went to millenia cafe, mad got her phone stolen, found the tourist office and police, found out there are many more markets, and talked with my partner about some things I’ve learned on this trip. I am going to do one more journal entry and then finish my crochet top. I feel that it was a heavy day for many and I just wish them some rest. Now, we move on to tomorrow.”
