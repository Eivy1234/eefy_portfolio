        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          My interests in the JSI program was one of the first steps I took into planning for my plans post-undergrad. As a first-generation college student, I was not familiar with the process of obtaining a Masters of PhD degree, especially in Education or Policy. While I am not sure when I will pursue these degrees, I knew that I wanted to gain insight into the benefits that a graduate degree can bring in my career.  
I was selected as a JSI Scholar at the University of Washington’s Evan’s School of Public Policy along with 20 other students from across the country. This program introduced me to some wonderful, passionate, and hard-working people from BIPOC, LGTBQ+, low-income and first-generation backgrounds. I am always in awe of other people’s passions and it is so energizing to be in community alongside my peers. 
During this program, we took graduate-level policy courses like economic, statistics, community leadership, and policy evaluation. Econ and stats were the two classes that I was looking forward to the most as I had not taken any previous classes. Additionally, I was most interested in the policy evaluation course because we evaluated a policy issue of our choice and conducted the process in assessing the outcomes. I have my final draft of my evaluation as one artifact. Lastly, the JSI program required us to complete a mini-capstone research project. The Caard linked in this annotation directs to our project on Food Insecurity. I do not have any specialization in nutrition or health policy but I did gain skills in conducting formal interviews and assessing the current landscape of a policy to create feasible solutions. 
While I am taking away vital policy knowledge and skills, the program did have some flaws in providing Seattle-based residents with appropriate housing, food, and financial resources. Furthermore, the programming itself was, at times, unorganized and culturally insensitive. I bring these critiques because it prohibited me from feeling fully valued in the space. But, it is also to share that my cohort voiced our concerns and advocated for ourselves when we felt it was needed to do so. Regardless of the challenges I faced, I do feel confident in applying to graduate schools and knowing what resources are available to me when I decide to take that next step.
