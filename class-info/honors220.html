        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This Zine served as my final project for Honors220C: Science, Technology, and Inequality. This class focused on the ways that technology and scientific research are used to produce racial inequalities. Despite the field of STEM being viewed as “objective” and “neutral,” I learned how biases and ideologies skew the implementation of equitable and accessible technologies. I was particularly interested in learning about surveillance technologies and how we interact with them on a casual, daily basis. 

I wanted my final project to connect between this subject and concepts that I didn’t always confront in my education or political science courses. Specifically, I wanted to analyze the actual tools used to produce over-surveillance within schools. My project resulted in a research paper on the Educational Technologies that facilitates the school-to-prison pipeline. I also was influenced by my role as a Middle School Coordinator at Canopy Scholars (a tutoring-center based in Shoreline, WA). As many of these students complete their learning in an online-hybrid model, I thought it was a prevalent topic that needed to be looked into. I created a magazine based on the research paper with the intention to share with my students. I was hoping that it could also be a resource available online as a condensed version of the issues with surveillance in schools. 

This project was meaningful to me because I was able to bridge my own work within the UW to the communities I was involved in. Being a first-generation college student, I have always considered how my attendance at a higher educational institution will impact those who are farthest from it. So, it felt valuable to use this project as a means to begin a conversation with my students about their own experience and to keep exploring these ideas. It also reassured me that while academia can feel like it operates isolated, I can find ways to bring my studies to the forefront of community work.
