        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I took this course because I had an interest in pursuing a minor in Public Policy and thought it would be a good introduction to the study. This class analyzed three Seattle neighborhoods to assess leadership types and Quadruple Bottom Line standards. While I decided not to take on the Public Policy Minor, I did learn a great deal about what a professional policy analysis may look like. I include my Northgate Memo as a display of the course concepts but also because this neighborhood has a special place in my heart! During my first two years of college, I lived only a few blocks away from the Northgate Light Rail. In my personal reflection of the document, I share the characters and recent changes that I observed during my time as a Northgate resident. Just as this area holds memories for myself, space is a form of legacy and should be reflective of the community that inhabits the area. However, financial, social, environmental, and cultural shifts influence the whose values are most reflected in the neighborhood.
