         This was a class that I was really looking forward to since the introduction of the Education Policy Specialization in the College of Ed. I learned a handful of important terminology in education policy literature and concepts about school reforms. One of the core tenants of this class is to introduce basic research practices. At the end of the quarter, we give a presentation about a policy issue of our choice using data and evidence from an interview that we conduct. I formed a group that wanted to learn more about the changes that public universities are facing with current financial restraints. For privacy reasons, I cannot share the information from the interview but I can share the protocol in which we followed. I think that collecting qualitative data is a very meticulous process and needs to be presented neutrally despite our own opinions. I was also surprised to see how much additional information and the generation conversation from these questions. Overall, this was a very informative class and I am sure that Iâ€™ll continue to interact with this content in my future academics.
