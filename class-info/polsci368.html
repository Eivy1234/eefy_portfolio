        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          International affairs is a topic within Political Science that I donâ€™t have a lot of engagement with or particular interest in, but I did learn important information especially as world affairs shape our understanding of collective freedom. In the course, I studied the goals of the United Nations and the purpose of the International Criminal Court. I quickly learned that these national organizations are very limited in their power to enforce any international law or criminal case without the support of dominating countries (like the United States). While the symbol of international cooperation is perhaps necessary to prevent any world chaos, international standards are seemingly in the hands of the few. In my first paper, I discussed how human rights, as defined by the United Nations, is influenced by Western powers which further maintains Western dominance over other countries. This course reminded me of a book I had read, Against White Feminism, in which Rafia Zakaria discusses that feminism (and further human rights) are not inherently intersectional unless there is an equal footing of power. Despite these reflections, I also believe that international relationships serve an important role. As the world continues to watch the active genocide against the Palestinan and Sudanese people, the internatinal community still has an obligation in protecting human life.
