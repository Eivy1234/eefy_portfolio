        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          As an out-of-Seattle student, I thoroughly enjoyed the connections that this course brought me. This class required a cumulative research project that documented the history, demographics, changing landscape, and a community interview of a Seattle neighborhood. This was my first interaction with the Beacon Hill community and I have remained connected through the organization of El Centro De La Raza. El Centro is a community organization that offers legal, economic, and cultural resources for members of the Beacon Hill Community. After learning of the rich history and collective organizing that has preserved the space, it is crushing to witness the active displacement and gentrification of the BIPOC, low-income community. I connect their history to that of the community organizing I am currently witnessing back home. Despite this, Beacon Hill remains incredibly resilient. As my community actively fights erasure and displacement in this current time, the spaces that preserve legacy and memory are vital to our existence. 
          Additionally, I absolutely adored my group and we worked incredibly well together. They really set the standards for my group projects moving forwards. Shoutout to them and Yahir for bringing in donuts on the last day!!
