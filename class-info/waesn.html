        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
UCBI was the first activity I participated in during my undergraduate experience. This two-quarter long internship paired students with a partner organization, provided mentorship, and professional development. As one of two freshmen in the cohort, I felt that I had a lot to learn and prove to myself that I belonged to take on this internship. My mentor, Susan, and my group mates were so supportive every step of the way. They offered advice on boundary setting, work-life balances, and just introduced me to new spaces in Seattle! And of course, this experience allowed me to take on the role of Elementary Intern at Canopy Scholars and stay involved for years to come. 
	As an Elementary Intern, I supported the management of the elementary room, assisting tutors and students with homework help, and organizing daily materials. There are a handful of memorable moments during my first year at Canopy. One of these moments when I was introduced to Tema Okunâ€™s Characteristics of White Supremacy in which we reflected on the ways that Canopy can stray away from perpetuating these harmful practices. I constantly think back to the ways that I challenge these ideals, especially when working alongside students. This is one resource I carry with me in all my work spaces. 
Another one of my favorite memories was the end-of-the-year celebration. My only other coworker had a birthday near the end of the program so she decided to bring sweet treats to share with everyone. I remember seeing all the kids so excited to pick out their cupcakes and just play outside with one another before the end of the year. My elementary school students were also so mesmerized by my polaroid camera and so we were snapping so many pictures of everyone! It was a very heartwarming movement and is part of the reason why I continued to stay involved in years to come. 
The picture is me at our symposium presentations. I displayed some of the work from the kids and talked about all that I had learned in my first year at Canopy!
