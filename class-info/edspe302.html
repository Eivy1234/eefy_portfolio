        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Growing up, I have always been familiar with the idea of disability because I have family
members with mental and physical disabilities. As a multigenerational and immigrant family, not all of my family members received medical diagnosis or treatment which also shaped my understanding of accessibility from a young age. This course was the first ever that focused specifically on the identity of disability and the issue of ableism. I believe that all educators have an obligation to hold an intersectional perspective of education justice as students bring diverse identities along with them. In order to serve students appropriately, they must be given access to fully participate in learning spaces freely. 
In this class, we were split into groups that ran like a little “Book Club” which engaged in
different mediums of work from Disabled Artists. I listened to a handful of episodes from the Disability Visibility Podcast, hosted by Alice Wong. We explored a range of topics that not only discussed barriers to education but to other facets of life. As part of my artifact, I offer a reflection of one of the episodes but I do recommend hearing the story for yourself. Alice and the other podcast guests offer their vulnerability which leaves a deep impression on all their listeners.
