        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          First things first, Professor Wallace is amazing! If you are in the political science field, I 100% recommend taking one of her classes. I appreciated how she affirmed my writing abilities and even recommended academic opportunities/programs for me to consider in the future. 
I took this class during the 2024 Federal Election, so you can imagine that the topic of immigration was incredibly relevant. I had expressed some anxiety about the possibility of mass deportations to Prof. Wallace and she mentioned how that is a costly task. We talked about how Trump’s administration differed from his previous term in 2016 and what that meant for immigration. At the time, I had a bit more faith in our systems to prevent the possibility of mass deportations but Trump’s current policies are violent, inhumane, and completely illegal. This is not the first time the United States has carried out mass deportations, especially amongst Mexican-immigrants. 
As part of my artifact and group project, I share the history of the Bracero Program. While the Bracero Program brought Mexican laborers to the United States’ agricultural fields, it also led to the eventual mass deportation of 1 million Mexican people (even those with U.S. citizenship) known as Operation Wetback. We are witnessing history repeat itself. The ability to “legally” reside in the United States is not solely based on constitutional right but on the ability for the government to dispose and displace those they no longer view as desirable or human.
