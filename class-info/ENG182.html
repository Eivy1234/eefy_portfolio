        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          This artifact is the ePortfolio I created as the final project to ENG182. I enjoyed that ability to explore various forms of multimodal writing and the creative freedom to explore topics that interest us. One of these topics I chose to analyze was the impact of manifestos in todayâ€™s modern world. This curiosity sparked from my general interest in Political Science and how the impact of manifestos influence a group's outward goals and purpose. Furthermore, this portfolio was the first I had ever made through the Canvas platform which brought its own technical challenges. Overall, I made connections between my different projects to showcase how I successfully learned the course objectives.
