          This class was also conducted through an interactive model in which we explored various spaces in Seattle to observe how learning is conducted across and within settings. Our project specifically looked at how learning is developed through art and art-based organizations. My personal favorite space to visit was Coyote Central, a non-profit organization that provides little-to-no-cost art programming for adolescents. We visited Coyote Central for a Valentine’s Day Event and they had the best scones ever! My group made this incredibly memorable and it’s this project that brought us together as friends . We were all deeply invested in this project that we created a coloring book with the idea to distribute them to the organizations we visited. Overall, it was a project and class that meant a lot to me as art and creativity will always be integral spaces for our learning but also for our collective expression.
