        facing complexity

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Recall the grand vision of becoming a lawyer I had way back in the fall quarter of this year? This class challenged the goals and ideals I had of the legal system. In order to succeed in the class, it took a lot of work and dedication to reviewing all those Supreme Court cases. Civil law intrigued me because it is a defense to our constitutional rights and attempts to place boundaries between the complex relationship of the government and people. In some cases, I agreed with the rulings whereas I deeply disagreed with others. It was through this review that I internalized the fact that the role of the Supreme Court is to defend the status quo (a constitution written by wealthy and racist White men). While I believe that institutional change happens within and outside of those spaces, I was really facing a moral dilemma in considering whether I wanted to participate in a system that is inherently violent. It is not designed to advocate for the rights of marginalized groups but does offer protections from the government. It is this complexity of the law as both violent and emancipatory that left me quite hopeless about my career ambitions. After many hours reflecting on my next steps, I am not ruling out the possibility of becoming a lawyer but I think it was necessary for me to challenge my ~romanticized~ perspective.
