        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Reconnecting with music theory was very familiar and easy. Since the 5th grade, I have played the violin first through orchestra ensembles and then through mariachi bands. I became really passionate about music and sound over the years and it’s partly because of the connection music has with my community. Because of music, I create life-long memories and friendships that still uplift me to this day. So, taking this class made me feel like an absolute expert. I appreciated that the class was structured to bring our own musical interests into the space. For this discussion post, we were asked to list a song that highlights dynamics, pitch and tempo and I immediately thought of the song, Por Una Cabeza by Mariachi Sol De México. It is a lovely instrumental song with varying tempos and dynamics. I enjoyed being able to bring my cultural heritage into this space especially because music has always been closely tied to who I am and to my ancestors.
