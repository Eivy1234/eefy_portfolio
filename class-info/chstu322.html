        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          In the class, we watched a lot of movies (wow what a surprise!). But, we also discussed at-length about the roles that Chicanos took within the filmmaking industry. Additionally, we analyzed the stereotypes that were forced upon, or willingly taken on, by actors of all backgrounds to represent Chicanos.  Zoot Suit was my favorite film of the course because it gives platform to one event in which Chicanos were overcriminalized through their clothing. I also enjoyed the theatrical elements of the film (like breaking the fourth-wall). I link that trailer here and I believe that the film is available at the UW libraries, so I recommend you watch it!
