        <p>
          I took this class as another opportunity to learn about the history of labor movements and the relationship between power and work. We reviewed how the U.S. government has implemented legislation that has both supported and limited the agency of labor unions and protections of worker’s rights. The Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, the U.S. is a prime example of the rise of neoliberalism and the “rolling back” of labor protections. The implementation of this bill gave power back to the States to control welfare and ultimately supported the privatization of healthcare. Due to the lack of access to healthcare for marginalized folks, I became interested in researching the outlets that community members take to receive care through mutual aid. Furthermore, I learned of the Social Reproduction Theory and how this practice spiked during the COVID-19 pandemic. The assignments in this class became incredibly personal to me and enhanced my view of socio-economic power imbalances.
