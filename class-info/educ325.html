        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Oh look! Here’s another class that I enjoyed so much! While I knew of some of the ways that our education system is currently inaccessible and inequitable, I felt that I needed a holistic understanding of the history of education for BIPOC communities. As I’ve said before, history is incredibly important in order to reform our institutions and rectify systemic shortcomings. This class came at the time when I was really interested in the archives. I was particularly interested in exploring how our education system has perceived white supremacy while actively forcing assimilation and subordination amongst Indigenous and Black communities. I wanted to share a few highlights from one of the first readings we were assigned that encompasses the course concepts.
