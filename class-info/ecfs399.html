        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
         ECFS 399 was taught by Joel Ryan, a very untraditional professor who had a handful of experiences outside the classroom (as a lawyer and HeadStart Employee) but his passion for this topic really showed in how he taught this course. As we reflected on government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were required to take a firm stance on opposing opinions. While I somewhat dreaded the need to defend my position wholeheartedly, I was so interested in this topic as it combined schools, policy, and community. Ryan was an incredibly supportive professor and encouraged us to move our conversations beyond the classroom. This course really represents intentionality as we have to be able to critically defend our positions and create compelling solutions.
