        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Now I know you’re probably wondering, girl, why did you take an accounting class?,
and my answer to you would be, I genuinely don’t know I was just missing math…
	At the time, I thought accounting would be the middle ground to getting some straightforward assignments but without committing to taking a real college-level math course. However, I learned quickly that was not the case. This was completely out of my field of interests but I did learn (mostly) how to write an account ledger soo there’s that. To add on, the very first midterm test we took I received an 87% which I actually pretty good for the course. What can I say? I am just made for business I guess. But no, in all seriousness, I felt incredibly lost following the rest of the quarter. I left the second midterm and final feeling like I was not grasping a single concept and that I was the only one struggling. Fortunately, I knew that this would pass and I would never have to be expected to know anything about accounting ledgers after the Fall quarter. Honestly, it made me not miss math anymore. #byemath
