        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p>
          Though I’ve said this many times, Honors210 altered my perspective of my academic
purpose way earlier before I even realized it now. This is when I began to reflect on the purpose of archives, and in this class specifically, it was the archives of Black sound. I learned so much of prominent Black artists in shaping music, sound, culture, and community as we know it to be through multimedia sources (music, documentaries, literature). 
The photo to the left is from a visit we made to Suzzallo Library in which we literally were given a tour of the archives. From newspapers, movies discs, to even older studio audio technologies, we explored the space of these “official preservation” sites. It wasn’t until my study abroad to Peru that I recognized my own passion for the archives. As the descendant of immigrants, I thought about how we preserve memories and stories in our communities. How do generations hold onto the archives of our ancestors? How do institutions persevere or forget the stories of marginalized people? What are we choosing and able to “preserve” and what gets left behind? 
These questions are carried with me as I continue to work in shaping equitable schools through ethnic studies implementation. I also realize the importance of documenting the stories of my grandparents, my own experiences, and that of my community members who are actively being ripped away from their families. Memory and stories are what sustains our collective soul. If we are forgotten, then our stories, identities, language, and communities cease to exist.
